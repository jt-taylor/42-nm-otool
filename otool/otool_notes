so we are only suposed to write this as otool -t
	which if you look at the man for otool-classic it just says
	```-t     Display the contents of the (__TEXT,__text) section.  With the -v flag, this disassembles the text.  With the -V flag, it also  symbolically disassembles the operands.```
	which at least before iv'e written it doesn't look to complecated
	this project feels a lot like the ft_tar rush
